## Hi there, I'm Prayus!

I'm an aspiring software engineer pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science [@UBC](http://ubc.ca/) . I've interned twice in the past before: firstly [@iStall](http://istall.ca/) (a local SaaS startup that simplifies parking), then [@MealMe](http://mealme.ai/) (an SF-based food startup, self-dubbed as "the hungriest startup in the world").

Feel free to check out my [website](https://prayusshrestha.github.io/personal-website/) and/or [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/prayus-shrestha/) page to learn more about me, or email me at <prayuss@yahoo.com>. Thanks for visiting!
