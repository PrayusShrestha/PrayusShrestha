## Hi there, I'm Prayus!

I'm an aspiring software engineer pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at [UBC](http://ubc.ca/). I've completed 3 internships, most recently at [Capital One](https://www.capitalone.com) where I developed backend services using Java Spring and MongoDB, and an ETL pipeline using Scala, AWS, Spark, and Kafka. Before Capital One, I've interned at [iStall](http://istall.ca/) (a local SaaS startup that simplifies parking) and [MealMe](http://mealme.ai/) (an SF-based food startup, self-dubbed as "the hungriest startup in the world").

Feel free to check out my [website](https://prayusshrestha.github.io/personal-website/) and/or [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/prayus-shrestha/) page to learn more about me, or email me at <prayuss@yahoo.com>. Thanks for visiting!
